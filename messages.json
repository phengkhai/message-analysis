    "- The Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy’s Food Compass, unveiled in late 2021, is another Great Reset tool designed to discourage consumption of animal foods by falsely rating them as unhealthy, and encouraging consumption of ultraprocessed foods by giving them high nutritional ratings\n- Food Compass rates Frosted Mini Wheats as three times healthier than ground beef, with a score of 87 out of 100, compared to 26 for ground beef\n- Food Compass also gives high scores to fries, Lucky Charms, Honey Nut Cheerios, chocolate covered almonds and almond M&Ms, while rating whole egg fried in butter, cheddar cheese and ground beef as foods that should be avoided. Based on this tool, you’ll be healthier if you replace whole egg, cheddar cheese and ground beef with candy\n- Studies have repeatedly shown that diets high in processed foods lead to poor health and depression, and the more processed your diet is, the greater your risk of obesity and chronic diseases that shave years, if not decades, off your life span\n- Health, food security, independence and freedom are what the global elitists, led by the World Economic Forum, intend to destroy so that they can then roll out a new food system based entirely on patented, processed imitation foods, including lab-grown and plant- or fungi-based “meats” and “clean, green” protein alternatives such as cricket meal and mealworms\n\n",

    "\"Trent Loos, 55, whose ancestors arrived on the land from Germany two centuries ago, knows what real sustainability looks like, and what makes it possible: fuel—precisely what globalist Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and their global partners want to nix by 2030 with their climate agenda. “Conservation is about producing more with less,” Loos told The Epoch Times. “In 1900, it took ten acres of land to produce enough food to feed one person per year. In 2021, it takes less than a third of an acre.”\n\nThat’s all thanks to diesel power.\n\nAnd five of those ten acres went toward feeding mules and horses. Today, one gallon of diesel replaces 500 man-hours of labor. And that, says Loos, is the real reason for the attack on fossil fuels. “With fuel, we can continually get through the efficiency of producing more food with fewer inputs,” he said. “Without fuel, we go back to the horse-and-buggy days, which is a regression of 100 years.”\"\n\n",

    "What was known previously as energy credits appears to have evolved to upcoming carbon based credit system. \n\n\"Technocracy’s plan was to replace the price system with a system based on energy. In the 1920s, Scott and his colleagues began a hugely ambitious program called the Energy Survey of North America. The idea was to establish a value for all the goods and services produced on the continent, not by measuring how much labour was expended or how much money was spent, but on the amount of energy used to produce them.\n\nThey would then divide the total amount of energy used by the number of citizens in the Technate over the age of 25, and issue each of those citizens an equal number of Energy Certificates, whether they were employed or not. These certificates would be the Technate’s currency.\n\nEvery time you bought something, some of your energy credits would be deducted, and because the certificates would be issued directly to the owner, they couldn’t be bought, sold, traded or stolen.

    "Climate Change is overwhelmingly due to solar activity. \n\n\"The complex dynamics of solar activity appear to be characterized by a number of oscillations ranging from monthly to multimillennial timescales, the most well-known of which being the 11-year Schwabe sunspot cycle. Solar oscillations are important because they also characterize the oscillations observed in Earth’s climate and can thus be used to explain and forecast climate changes. Thus, it is important to investigate the physical origin of solar oscillations. There appear to be two possibilities: either the oscillations in solar activity are exclusively controlled by internal solar dynamo mechanisms, or the solar dynamo is partially synchronized to planetary frequencies by planetary forcings. The latter concept has recently gained support from a growing amount of evidence. In this work, we provide an overview of the many empirical facts that would support a planetary hypothesis of the variability of solar activity and emphasize their importance for climate research. We show that the frequencies produced by the complex interactions of all of the planets are coherent with the major solar activity and climate cycles, from monthly to multimillennial timescales, including the well-known Schwabe 11-year solar cycle. We provide some persuasive theoretical and empirical support for the planetary hypothesis of solar and climate variability.\"\n\n",

We are being intentionally exposed to high levels of UVs/IR's spectrum, far beyond what is naturally produced by the sun, as well as extreme levels of radiation, far exceeding the threshold of any\nliving organisms spectrum requirements.\n\nA temporary \"Global warming\" is being engineered and the effects of a \"climate crisis\" are intentionally being\nfacilitated for numerous agendas."

Orange county, California, alone put the cost of cleaning its system at $1bn.\n\n“While over a billion dollars is real money, it is a virtual drop in the bucket of potential utility costs to monitor, remove and dispose of these contaminants in accordance with anticipated federal regulations,” the American Municipal Water Association trade group said in a statement.\n\nMoreover, the two settlements include just over 6,000 water systems nationwide. Utilities that were not part of the suits but have PFAS in their systems can claim some of the settlement money, or they can sue the chemical manufacturers on their own.\n\nThat means the settlements only represent the first wave of utility lawsuits to hit chemical manufacturers, legal observers say.

The first person to get physical loses the debate. \n \n👉Why join?  \n \nJoin because misguided (but certainly guilty) activists will once again whine, complain, cry about a fabricated crisis in order to gain as much attention as possible to make up for their self-worth deficit.  \n \nActivists and environmental volunteers group wants to raise carbon taxes, impose expensive ESG on the economy, imposed inefficient solar energy into the grid and raise energy prices.

The first person to get physical loses the debate. \n \n👉Why join?  \n \nJoin because misguided (but certainly guilty) activists will once again whine, complain, cry about a fabricated crisis in order to gain as much attention as possible to make up for their self-worth deficit.  \n \nActivists and environmental volunteers group wants to raise carbon taxes, impose expensive ESG on the economy, imposed inefficient solar energy into the grid and raise energy prices. Just so they feel good about themselves. \n\nStand with me to,\n🔵 Be against raising carbon tax and imposing other forms of climate socialism\n🔵 Be against expensive, wasteful, time consuming ESG red tapes\n🔵 Be against raising electricity prices due to non-effective solar panels\n🔵 Stand with me simply because you are sick and tied \n-of being shouted down at, and\n-lectured by people whom may are irresponsible with their predictions, \n-may not know better, out to guilt trip you for life, \n-and is interested to make life worst.\n \n \n❤️Join me in taking the pro- human progress and pro development stance against the the alarmists.  \n \n❤️Support me.  \n \n👉Recommended guidelines in engaging people at the rally,  \n \n💡 be nice and polite to politicians (PAP or Opposition).

    "\n\nAn important video from Neil Oliver.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing about it is this. \n\nThat JFK wasn’t killed by a lone gunman but by an arrangement which involved US government actors (the CIA) and others is no longer even disputed by government spooks. Nobody is deplatformed for saying this. \n\nAs Neil himself often says, “Here’s the thing”. This cannot be overstated.\n\nThose who react to suggestions that there’s something going on behind the claimed pandemic or about the claimed human induced climate change crisis with cries of “Conspiracy theorist!” need to take a long, cool look at the last 60 years, at least.\n\nWhat we have, even that far back in November 1963 in Dallas, Texas, is proof that senior elements in the US administration had no compunction in murdering an elected US President, for whatever reasons they had. The reasons are now immaterial in a sense, because it’s that murder of their fellow citizens is not a barrier for these people that is the key to what’s happening today.\n\nOne more thing. Blair lied to the British people and to parliament and the BBC aided & abetted him, in getting U.K. to join an illegal war in Iraq. He claimed that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch with notice no greater than 45 minutes. \n\nPresident Bush led off & U.K. armed forces joined in the destruction of a sovereign nation. Nobody thinks it’s a safer place for it’s people or it’s neighbouring countries either. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have predictably been killed, murdered by our lying leaders, lying right into our faces. The UN declared that war illegal. There isn’t any dispute about it.\n\nSo here we have at least two cases where we can be absolutely certain that officialdom lied to its own people about something so momentous that people were thereby killed. Deliberately. For whatever purposes.\n\nSo when people like me use all my substantial skill and career long judgement to tell anyone who’ll listen that the mRNA / DNA based injections were designed intentionally to cause injury and death, why would you not at least listen and demand the evidence, which I’ve often given?\n\nSimilarly, when those skilled in the science and practice of assessing climate & how it changes over time, and tell us that we’re being lied to about the importance of CO2 in this equation and that there’s no sign whatsoever of a crisis, now or imminently, why would one not at least consider the possibility that we’re being lied to, purposes unknown, by numerous authority figures?\n\nYou’d be very stubborn not to at least be alive to the possibility that you are being lied to by government and their agents. You’re off the foot of the “ladder of disbelief”. You know that politicians lie and that powerful people plot to their advantage.\n\nAll that’s being asked of you is that take a deliberately long, questioning look at both claimed pandemics as well as “safe and effective vaccines”, rustled up in an impossible timescale. All past vaccines took six or more years to bring to market and that was with skimpy clinical trials and readily mastered scaled up manufacturing. These unprecedented gene based injections are complex to manufacture and career experts in this niche of the pharmaceutical sector confirm it’s absolutely impossible that they did what they’ve said they did. \n\nAlso do the same with “climate change”, examining particularly papers on polar ice cores, which have repeatedly shown us that temperature changes preceded changes in CO2, over & again, meaning CO2 cannot be the major driver that you’re told it is. Keep your privately owned ICE car. \n\nThere’s more, but these are the brutal shoves being used to herd us into pens, such as “vaccine passports” from WHO and 15 minute cities from the UN, for purposes I don’t intend to elaborate on here.\n\nNobody is coming to save us. Nobody. But we can & must save ourselves by resisting and refusing these illegal shoves. \n\nPlease, do not sign up for digital ID or vaccine passports. Don’t stop using cash.\n\n👉 ",

So the globalists are using it in the opposite way to what you have been taught this word means.
