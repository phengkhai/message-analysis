This is how I see it.  There is a facade that if they remove ICE vehicles and convert residential energy to renewables that we will stop pumping fossil fuels.  This is a farce.  They will continue to pump just as much fossil fuels to continue running their industrial processes and pump out their product as listed in the diagram.  That won't change, ""they"" (i.e. the corporations do exert significant control on what happens in an economy and their greed knows no bound. 

So in a nutshell, what will happen in the future is they will say the general population can only use renewable and since industry is so critical to the well being of society that hydrocarbons are reserved for industry.

Now let's transition to economics.  If a huge segment of hydrocarbons demand is reduced then supply increases and prices goes down.  Industry gets a price discount while keeping pricing the same.  Expanded production ensues.  All this resulting in increased profits.  This may not be fully coordinated but it is the end result.  Assuming ""they"" get their way.

That diagram makes the incorrect assumption that ""they"" will end hydrocarbons.  That is fantasy, it will continue to pump, to the benefit of themselves and will translate into nothing to us, we will still have everything we have now.

What I am fighting for is having a rational energy policy that does not leave the general population at a disadvantage, and that includes hydrocarbons, nuclear and renewable if they make sense.

Farmers are the backbone for the wellbeing, health and existence of nations throughout the world.
The WEF and lying politicians like the Evil Ursula Von der lein are blaming the small farmers and the fertilizers they use as the major cause of climate, not the jets that the WEF rides in. What climate change are they talking about? Chemical industries are the biggest polluters of the quality of air.

The WEF wants to bankrupt the the farmers so that people like gates and Monsanto will pick up these farms dirt cheap and grow non nutritious gmo food , lab meat and insects as the main supply.

These big corporations and wealthy individuals will control
the entire food supply and they will control the price of food.

We all know what happened during Covid. Only the supermarkets and big chain stores were open. All the small stores were closed.

We saw oil go up to R100 for two litres of cooking oil.

Once the small farmer is destroyed, the majority of the world's population will die of starvation because they won't be able to afford the artificially manufactured food, the few  who can afford it will end up becoming ill through nutritional deficiencies. This will suit the pharmaceutical and supplement industry.

The farmers' protest is a protest for our survival and our rights, they need our full support.
Our government leaders are mere tools of the WEF.

If you think you are going to elect an official that represents you then you living cloud cookooland .
These clowns are in politics to see what they can get out of it for themselves. The most educated and most religious have been corrupted by the WEF. You don't hear about it because the media and news that you follow is all owned by the WEF.
I have stopped listening to local radios, i no longer watch television and read none of our papers but I still know what's going on in the world.
Support alternative independent media to get the truth and get rid of the lying mainstream media.

Some green funders hadnâ€™t given much attention to the LNG exports until recently, in part because of ambivalence about the role natural gas should play in the energy transition. Plus, some previous campaigns to kill LNG terminals had been unsuccessful, damping some donorsâ€™ and large environmental organizationsâ€™ appetite for taking on the industry.

If you thought the greatest challenge to our liberty anywhere was from faked pandemics, economy- and society-wrecking â€œcountermeasuresâ€ and intentionally injurious, sometimes lethal, false vaccines, I have worrisome news for you.

This utter nonsense about climate change has such heavyweight momentum behind it, with absolutely every stakeholder who has access to mass audiences already roped in, that I regard the billionaires desire to use it as a battering ram in the form of a â€œplanetary health emergencyâ€ is every bit as bad if not worse.

In a fake pandemic, you could declare that youâ€™re not prepared to play along and prefer isolation with other, unconcerned people. 

In an â€œanthropogenic climate emergencyâ€, despite nothing happening at all, thereâ€™s no such scenario possible, because everything you do involves you adding to the â€œalready unacceptable burdens upon our global commonsâ€.

Get out of that one, if you can.

Dr Jacob Nordangard takes us through the 75+ years of the â€œelitesâ€ painstaking planning that has brought us here.

It is all fakery. Weâ€™re not â€œdamaging the earthâ€™s climateâ€ one bit. The earth is not overpopulated. Despite fake modelling from the Club of Rome, thereâ€™s not a single unmanageable problem and in any case, population was already set to fall hard later this century in any case, now being given a firm push by â€œcovidâ€. Some say weâ€™re running out of â€œfossil fuelsâ€, but oddly enough, it gets not a single mention except to point out its dominant claimed contribution to â€œclimate emergencyâ€.

In my opinion, there is no doubt that depopulation is the overarching objective of all of this, together with permanent, real-time, totalitarian control of earths peons, which is you, me and everyone not in The Big Club.

As Iâ€™m often drawn to retort, â€œThere is a conspiracy. Thereâ€™s nothing theoretical about itâ€.

An international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASAâ€™s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planetâ€™s vegetated regions. The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States""

The topic: carbon dioxide (CO2), commonly mischaracterized as a harmful waste product of respiration and a pollutant that is disrupting the planetary climate. As explained by Happer in this lecture, CO2 is actually an essential gas necessary for life. Moreover, its impact on Earthâ€™s temperatures is negligible, and will remain negligible even if the current concentration in the atmosphere were to double.

But for the approximately 60,000 farmers in the Netherlands, agriculture is a way of life, often passed down through the generations â€” one thatâ€™s necessary to supply food for the population.

According to a press release for the film, â€œDutch farmers produce the most food per hectare of farmers anywhere, and the Netherlands is the worldâ€™s second largest exporter of agricultural products.â€

367,10/12/2023,TNanomaly EndTN,"This includes some strategic NGOs like the Sunway Centre for Planetary Health, advising the government on climate change.

Many politicians have been inducted into the WEF...

Former UMNO (later Bersatu) minister Mustapa Mohamed and current trade minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz were most probably the two principal purveyors of the WEF to the Malaysian scene.

Today there are a number of ministers and politicians who are members of the WEF. Until very recently most openly acknowledged their association with the WEF, but a number have asked the organization to take their names off the WEF official website. However, in searching names there are records of meetings they attended and/or spoke at.

Current members of the WEF in the government include Azalina Otham Said, member since 2003, Nurul Izzah Anwar, a member since 2012, Steven Sim, a member since 2012, Hannah Yeoh, a member since 2018, and Yao Bee Yin, a member since 2019.

Nurul Izzah, one of the WEFâ€™s rising stars.

Other notable politicians include Khairy Jamaluddin, a member since 2006, Hishammuddin Hussein, a member sine 1998, and Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, a member since 2019.

Malays have been indoctrinated that the Chinese covet control of Malaysia. The Malays are also taught to hate the Jews. However, these are just diversions to stop the Malays seeing what is really happening.

*Malays will continue to be serfs in their own land.* 

No one will see this story in the media, as much of the media is affiliated with the WEF. The government is now operating within the influence of the WEF. Malaysia is now almost unrecoverable from WEF influence.

If youâ€™ve been a fan of Steve Kirsch, I recommend you read this very carefully.

You may recall that, when he interviewed me earlier this year, he showed no interest whatsoever in my assertion that, based on over 30 years experience of â€œrational drug designâ€ rules, I was certain they had been designed intentionally to harm, kill & reduce fertility.
Instead of pushing back on this strong assertion, he tried to pick a fight with me about PCR tests, which I waved away as all but irrelevant given where we now were.

As the call closed, I put a line through yet another name.

Based on my own experience, you cannot be a freedom fighter AND retain an account with 100K+ followers on any social media platform and yet be genuine.
The perpetrators can silence you with a click, if they want to.

For this & several other reasons thereâ€™s no point in me attempting to set up an account on Twitter in my own name.

Do remember that nobody was ever coming to save us, but that we donâ€™t need someone to save us. We need only want to save ourselves enough to make that a reality.

Best wishes 
Mike

I follow Harry Metcalfe because heâ€™s got a garage full of wonderful cars. Heâ€™s obviously done well for himself, and he also farms (since 2002). 
A friend of Clarkson who lives nearby. 
Harry educates us on the climate impact myths of beef. It depends on geographic context and in places where growing grass is easy, there are no inputs other than little cows, to get big cows. 
The methane comes from carbohydrates trapped in grass by photosynthesis. Itâ€™s a cycle. Itâ€™s adds zero to fake climate change.
CO2 is anyway irrelevant.

An important video from Neil Oliver.

Perhaps the most important thing about it is this. 

That JFK wasnâ€™t killed by a lone gunman but by an arrangement which involved US government actors (the CIA) and others is no longer even disputed by government spooks. Nobody is deplatformed for saying this. 

As Neil himself often says, â€œHereâ€™s the thingâ€. This cannot be overstated.

Those who react to suggestions that thereâ€™s something going on behind the claimed pandemic or about the claimed human induced climate change crisis with cries of â€œConspiracy theorist!â€ need to take a long, cool look at the last 60 years, at least.

What we have, even that far back in November 1963 in Dallas, Texas, is proof that senior elements in the US administration had no compunction in murdering an elected US President, for whatever reasons they had. The reasons are now immaterial in a sense, because itâ€™s that murder of their fellow citizens is not a barrier for these people that is the key to whatâ€™s happening today.

One more thing. Blair lied to the British people and to parliament and the BBC aided & abetted him, in getting U.K. to join an illegal war in Iraq. He claimed that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch with notice no greater than 45 minutes. 

President Bush led off & U.K. armed forces joined in the destruction of a sovereign nation. Nobody thinks itâ€™s a safer place for itâ€™s people or itâ€™s neighbouring countries either. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have predictably been killed, murdered by our lying leaders, lying right into our faces. The UN declared that war illegal. There isnâ€™t any dispute about it.

So here we have at least two cases where we can be absolutely certain that officialdom lied to its own people about something so momentous that people were thereby killed. Deliberately. For whatever purposes.

So when people like me use all my substantial skill and career long judgement to tell anyone whoâ€™ll listen that the mRNA / DNA based injections were designed intentionally to cause injury and death, why would you not at least listen and demand the evidence, which Iâ€™ve often given?

Similarly, when those skilled in the science and practice of assessing climate & how it changes over time, and tell us that weâ€™re being lied to about the importance of CO2 in this equation and that thereâ€™s no sign whatsoever of a crisis, now or imminently, why would one not at least consider the possibility that weâ€™re being lied to, purposes unknown, by numerous authority figures?

Youâ€™d be very stubborn not to at least be alive to the possibility that you are being lied to by government and their agents. Youâ€™re off the foot of the â€œladder of disbeliefâ€. You know that politicians lie and that powerful people plot to their advantage.

All thatâ€™s being asked of you is that take a deliberately long, questioning look at both claimed pandemics as well as â€œsafe and effective vaccinesâ€, rustled up in an impossible timescale. All past vaccines took six or more years to bring to market and that was with skimpy clinical trials and readily mastered scaled up manufacturing. These unprecedented gene based injections are complex to manufacture and career experts in this niche of the pharmaceutical sector confirm itâ€™s absolutely impossible that they did what theyâ€™ve said they did. 

Also do the same with â€œclimate changeâ€, examining particularly papers on polar ice cores, which have repeatedly shown us that temperature changes preceded changes in CO2, over & again, meaning CO2 cannot be the major driver that youâ€™re told it is. Keep your privately owned ICE car. 

Thereâ€™s more, but these are the brutal shoves being used to herd us into pens, such as â€œvaccine passportsâ€ from WHO and 15 minute cities from the UN, for purposes I donâ€™t intend to elaborate on here.

Nobody is coming to save us. Nobody. But we can & must save ourselves by resisting and refusing these illegal shoves. 

Please, do not sign up for digital ID or vaccine passports. Donâ€™t stop using cash.

The truth is, there is quite a large group of climate scientists and academics in the field that disagree with the oversimplified view of climate change that is constantly being spouted, but the public is not told this.

The whole system revolves around the idea that the majority can be made to believe ðšð§ð²ð­ð¡ð¢ð§ð , so long as it is repeated loudly and often. And it works.

â€” NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden

Well worth a read, as it ties together principles of deception that apply to both main elements of the long-planned deception: civilisation-threatening human-caused climate change and global pandemics, both of which are flat lies.

While Iâ€™m no expert in climate science, Iâ€™m an adequate scientist and quite capable of understanding the published literature. Having spent months doing exactly that, I have found sufficient holes in the rather weak claims, very loudly made, that thereâ€™s a crisis related to climate change. Not only is this a lie, but release of CO2 is proven to be a minor factor in global temperature change and in fact follows temperature changes, not leads them. It therefore cannot be a major driver of climate change. This has been demonstrated beyond doubt decades ago. The rest is just lies. Scientists are no harder to buy that politicians.

471,31/10/2023,TChimpo,"EV market is a complete shambles.  I did a very very high level analysis of the Malaysian market for a project, just to figure some basic maths from the limited information I had.  So if you own a pure EV car and you got a home charger given you could only get an 11KWh charger it would take about a day to charge.  So you would need to likely top up at a fast charger if you could find one and pay  min 3x or more the cost of electricity at home.  Then most of the chargers were built for hybrid battery/petrol where 11KWh makes sense and would barely make any dent charging a full EV for a few hours.  Then you have way more chargers than are needed for the number of car because they got to address range anxiety so most chargers are idle.  I would say most are making a loss with a 5 year min break-even.

Then if Asian markets follow the western markets where those who want one will buy one and then growth drops significantly.  I think that's why we all of a sudden saw hug uptake in the last few years.  The west EV growth slowed and they pushed growing excess supply to the east.

Then it takes the excavation of 50 tons of earth to make one battery.

Then they talk about recycling old batteries but we all know that will never happen as there is no money in it and any business doing it will lose money.  So EV graveyards leaking toxic waste into the environment.

Why?  Because stupid ideas come to reality with free money from 0% interest rate environments.  It's all coming crashing down now that money is not free.

These and other tough questions are posed by Roman Balmakov, Epoch Times reporter and host of Facts Matter, in ""No Farmers, No Food: Will You Eat the Bugs?"" Balmakov says:

""The people in charge of some of the most powerful organizations on the planet have determined that agriculture, specifically animal agriculture is to blame for global warming, and global warming is to blame for the high prices of food as well as food shortages.

And so by switching our diets from beef, chicken and pork, to crickets and mealworms, we'll be able to stop temperatures from rising, lower the price of food and possibly to even save the planet.""

In the featured video, Bjorn Andreas Bull-Hansen, a best-selling Norwegian novelist, explains how the European Unionâ€™s ""Energy Performance of Buildings Directive"" â€” the legislative instrument that dictates the energy performance standards for buildings within the EU â€” will be used to achieve a massive wealth transfer scheme.

In March 2023, the EU Parliament voted to revise this directive as part of a ""Fit for 55"" package, which aims to meet a minimum 55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

By 2050, the EU intends to achieve a ""zero-emission and fully decarbonized building stock."" In short, by 2050, they want every building â€” commercial, public and residential â€” in the EU to meet zero-emission standards. To achieve that, they will impose a slew of new requirements on homeowners.

2)he assumes higher CO2 = higher temp = no food (unscientific)

Climatologists state that global temperatures are affected mainly by sun, ocean currents and volcanoes, â€¦not the man made CO2 which accounts for 3% of the 0.04% of the air. 
When CO2 increases plants thrive and crops will yield more food. 

When net Zero is reached humans (made up of carbon) will be depopulated significantly due the collapse of agriculture and economies because green energy is very inefficient and expensive.

639,20/9/2023,Henry,"Hi everyone,  
 
Climate Rally Singapore is around the corner,  
23 Sept, 3-6pm,  
Speakers Corner, Hong Lim Park.  

ðŸAnti Climate Alarmism Peaceful Counter RallyðŸ
 
I invite you join my anti climate alarmism coalition as a visual representation against climate alarmism.  
 
ðŸ‘‰You can do this by wearing white and standing with me in the rally. 
 
ðŸ‘‰We do this show the world that, environmentalists are a loud minority voice and not representative of what the commoners want.  
 
ðŸ‘‰Join me in this peaceful (non physical) and intellectual venture, as I will challenge any environmentalists for a debate, on the spot.  
 
I will also be furnishing facts and invite open minded enough people to take a second look on climate alarmism.  
 
I will be ready with laminated notes armed with sources links and QR codes, to show (in loving details) why climate alarmism (environmentalism) is 180 degrees wrong and evil.  
 
This is a verbal (non violent) and intellectual contest. The first person to get physical loses the debate. 
 
ðŸ‘‰Why join?  
 
Join because misguided (but certainly guilty) activists will once again whine, complain, cry about a fabricated crisis in order to gain as much attention as possible to make up for their self-worth deficit.  
 
Activists and environmental volunteers group wants to raise carbon taxes, impose expensive ESG on the economy, imposed inefficient solar energy into the grid and raise energy prices. Just so they feel good about themselves. 

Stand with me to,
ðŸ”µ Be against raising carbon tax and imposing other forms of climate socialism
ðŸ”µ Be against expensive, wasteful, time consuming ESG red tapes
ðŸ”µ Be against raising electricity prices due to non-effective solar panels
ðŸ”µ Stand with me simply because you are sick and tied 
-of being shouted down at, and
-lectured by people whom may are irresponsible with their predictions, 
-may not know better, out to guilt trip you for life, 
-and is interested to make life worst.
 
 
â¤ï¸Join me in taking the pro- human progress and pro development stance against the the alarmists.  
 
â¤ï¸Support me.  
 
ðŸ‘‰Recommended guidelines in engaging people at the rally,  
 
ðŸ’¡ be nice and polite to politicians (PAP or Opposition). Constantly, â£ï¸inviteâ£ï¸them to â™¦ï¸reconsider â™¦ï¸climate alarmism. Point them to me, I have a VIP package handout for them.  
 
ðŸ’¡debate with climate activists to show them how wrong they are. I brought facts, in laminated posters. 
 
ðŸ’¡do not sound like a conspiracy theorists. Do not look as if you are oneâ€¼ï¸You are not fighting WEF, illuminati, Bilderberg or some other global cabal etc. It is just that people are incompetent to handle the bad ideologies, sensationalism, and broken information system between academia and media.  
 
ðŸ‘‰""Are you a denierâ“""

-no and don't fall into this trap when questioned
 
âœ”You believe in rise in temperature 
âœ”You believe CO2 is a GHG 
âœ”You believe in man contributing to CC and/global warming.  
 
âŒit is just that there is simply no climate crisis. We can believe in climate change without believing in climate catastrophe. Especially, when we are living in the best time in all history of humanity.  
 
This is because, we are very well insulated from the climate thru fossil fuel powered concretes, steel and plastics.  
 
As a result, climate related death had fallen 98% over the last 100 years.  
 
Even according to the environmentalistsâ€™ own IPCC scriptures, extreme weather events are not detected to rise since 1950s.  
 
This is how you push back, 
 
â­•Be smart. 
â­•Be issue based. 
â­•Don't be political. 
â­•Be extra polite and nice to politicians. (PAP and Opposition)
â­•Don't sound like a conspiracy theorists. 
â­•Know who to offend, and who not to offend. 
â­•Know what position to defend and what position not to take. 
â­•Invite people to â™¦ï¸reconsiderâ™¦ï¸against the narrative

The Governmentâ€™s Energy Bill comes before the Commons when MPs return from their summer break on Tuesday.

Under the bill Ministers want to grant themselves powers to create new criminal offences  and increase civil penalties as part of efforts to hitÂ NET ZERO.  

If you fall foul of regulations to reduce your energy consumption, you could face up to a year in prison and fines of up to Â£15,000.  You could also be prosecuted for â€œprovision of false informationâ€ about energy efficiency or the â€œobstruction of an enforcement authorityâ€.

This has to STOP.

Criminal offences are an exceptional use of state power. They require full constitutional scrutiny and should NEVER be introduced by a minister under secondary legislation.

Make sure your MP knows that you will not except the criminalisation of the use of energy as you see fit, to achieve net zero which you have not voted for.

We will be deep diving this bill over the coming weeks and intend to hold an online forum about it which you are welcome to join.

WEF Caught Paying Arsonists To 'Burn Down the World' as Part of Sick Depopulation Plan

Far-left arsonists are engaged in a globalist plot to â€œburn down the worldâ€ according to a WEF insider who warns that humanity has been primed to fall for the globalist eliteâ€™s three-card trick.

The global elite laid the groundwork with the Covid pandemic, training the masses to be compliant, while pre-programming them with years of climate change propaganda in the media. As far as they are concerned, the wildfires are the final nail in our coffin.

Climate change is not only a hoax, it is a decades-old global depopulation plot, and WEF-infiltrated governments all over the world are going along with it.

718,30/8/2023,TNanomaly EndTN,"News From Vostok Ice Cores â€¢  
""General CO2-lag in ice-core records and the lack of warming over the last 8000 years of extraordinary increase in CO2Â show that the hypothesis of significant warming of the atmosphere by CO2Â over the last century is absurd. Attribution of derivative effects (i.e. â€œclimate changeâ€) to CO2Â is, therefore, ridiculous. 
These fictions, the dire prophecies that attend them and the disparagement of those that question them, however, are vigorously promoted and widely accepted. They seem to be as important socially as they are false scientifically.
While recent snow at Vostok adds to the falsification of the hypothesis of â€œdangerous man-made climate change by carbon-dioxide,Â a powerful heat-trapping greenhouse-gasâ€, such falsification was evident in the ice-core data published in 1999 and has always been logically obvious to anyone with an understanding of the carbon cycle at the surface of the earth.
For distraction from abuse by the saviors of planets, polar bears, putative grandchildren, etc., those of us with some affection for natural science might consider what news from Vostok (or Dome Fuji or Dome C) would indicate that climate might be trending beyond the limits of the last 400000 years.""

Is that the BIGGEST challenge we as Singaporeans are facing?

When opposition MPs ask for help to manage the above, they are accused of wanting to raid the reserves. But when the elitist leaders want to spend S$100 BILLION  SOLELY for climate change, itâ€™s not a problem.  How will they fund this? No wonder they have to take back the whole chicken after giving out chicken wings.

 In 2015 the leaders of 193 countries signed their population up to Agenda 2030

What is Sustainable Development (SD)?
 SD is ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsâ€

Core Principles: 

Universality  (all countries committed to whole Agenda regardless of any unique factors)

Leaving No One Behind  (all people will be included; â€œwith unprecedented need for data to ensure this principle is metâ€)

Interconnectedness and Indivisibility  â€“ no pick and mix approach to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) â€“ all to be followed

Inclusiveness  â€“ the entire population must follow 

Multi Stakeholder Partnerships  â€“ establishment seen as essential to deliver all SDGâ€™s

Dimensions of the Agenda (the 5Ps)
 People, Prosperity, Planet, Partnership and Peace

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
 Used to focus on areas necessary to achieve SD

Each SDG has 8-12 targets & 1-4 indicators of progress 

SDG'S:

Goal 1:  End poverty 
Goal 2:  End hunger
Goal 3:  Ensure healthy lives 
Goal 4:  Quality education 
Goal 5:  Gender equality
Goal 6 : Water/sanitation for all
Goal 7:  Affordable clean energy for all
Goal 8:  Economic growth/full + productive employment 
Goal 9:  Resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization/innovation
Goal 10:  Reduce inequality within and among countries
Goal 11:  Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient & sustainable
Goal 12:  Ensure sustainable consumption + production patterns
Goal 13:  Combat climate change 
Goal 14:  Conserve/sustainably use oceans, seas & marine resources 
Goal 15:  Promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, deserts & land 
Goal 16:  Promote inclusive societies, access to justice + accountable institutions

â€œCiting extensive data to support their case, William Happer, professor emeritus in physics at Princeton University, and Richard Lindzen, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argued that the claims used by the EPA to justify the new regulations are not based on scientific facts but rather political opinions and speculative models that have consistently proven to be wrong. 

More CO2 in the atmosphere leads to more plant growth and higher farming yields, they argued. In addition, synthetic fertilizers, which are derivatives of natural gas, are responsible for nearly half the worldâ€™s food production today. â€˜Net zeroâ€™ goals would reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40 gigatons per year, reducing the food supply proportionally, they said.â€

At this point sweat â€” the body's main tool for bringing down its core temperature â€” no longer evaporates off the skin, eventually leading to heatstroke, organ failure and death.

This critical limit, which occurs at 35Â°C of what is known as ""wet bulb temperature"", has only been breached around a dozen times, mostly in South Asia and the Persian Gulf, Dr Colin Raymond of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.""

But while the sums are impressive on their face, they represent just a fraction of the estimated $400bn some estimate will be needed to clean and protect the nationâ€™s drinking water. Orange county, California, alone put the cost of cleaning its system at $1bn.

â€œWhile over a billion dollars is real money, it is a virtual drop in the bucket of potential utility costs to monitor, remove and dispose of these contaminants in accordance with anticipated federal regulations,â€ the American Municipal Water Association trade group said in a statement.

Moreover, the two settlements include just over 6,000 water systems nationwide. Utilities that were not part of the suits but have PFAS in their systems can claim some of the settlement money, or they can sue the chemical manufacturers on their own.

That means the settlements only represent the first wave of utility lawsuits to hit chemical manufacturers, legal observers say. Because PFAS are so widely used and the scale of their harm is so great, chemical makers will get hit from a range of legal angles, and some suspect the industryâ€™s final bill could exceed the $200bn paid by big tobacco in the 1990s.""

This series of wildfires began in the spring and the causes are being blamed on the narrative of man-made climate change. 

Mac Isaac is not afraid to openly express his personal opinion on this and has already had to suffer reprisals from the Canadian government, which has censored his expressions of opinion. This dictatorial approach of the government to suppress freedom of expression is reminiscent of the harsh persecution of the ""Truckers for Freedom"" movement in the so-called ""Corona Pandemic"", when many courageous people rebelled against the incipient totalitarianism in Canada.

Singapore's accounts for 0.2 % of global emission. Even if all world governments are competent enough to impose the Paris agreement, it would only amount to reducing global emission by 1%.

We are not in a climate crisis, according to Global Burden Diseases latest 2019 data, climate related deaths account for only 0.095% of total deaths and 0.138% lost in Daily adjusted life years.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/11/05/118-private-jets-take-leaders-to-cop26-climate-summit-burning-over-1000-tons-of-co2/?fbclid=IwAR2j-yriXcHM209Kz8DnqMc3o0w9hpqwygbN7rAje8a6MyQRm-t53F7TWOE&sh=36f545db53d9 

As the COP26 climate conference opened on Monday (1 November), 50 private jets landed at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, ferrying their passengers to one of the most critical environmental summits in history.


In the run-up to the event, 118 different business jets flew into the airports, according to data compiled by WingX, an aviation consultancy. Overall, inbound private jets to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports were up 525% on the opening day of the summit compared with the previous seven days.

Those taking private jets to and from COP24 include Jeff Bezos, Prince Charles and Boris Johnson, who was criticized for flying back to London to attend a dinner on Wednesday evening. Others made an exit to Cannes in the South of France, and Bern in Switzerland, according to flights tracked by FlightRadar24.

Private jets are, by far, the most inefficient way to travel, and many have pointed out the hypocrisy of turning up to a summit on climate change on something that is contributing to its very cause.

If all 118 private jets at COP26 flew an average of three hours to and from the event that would put the combined carbon emitted by the 118 private jets at over 1,400 tons.

â€œOur research has found that most journeys could easily be completed on scheduled flights. Private jets are very prestigious but it is difficult to avoid the hypocrisy of using one while claiming to be fighting climate change,â€ says Matt Finch, U.K. policy manager at the Transport and Environment campaign group.

Flying a private jet between Glasgow and Rome, where many leaders were previously attending the G20 summit, emits roughly six tons of CO2 per flight, though estimates vary according to aircraft and weight.","hypocrisy - mantra â€œ say â€ / http : //www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/11/05/118-private-jets-take-leaders-to-cop26-climate-summit-burning-over-1000-tons-of-co2/ ? fbclid=iwar2j-yrixchm209kz8dnqmc3o0w9hpqwygbn7raje8a6myqrm-t53f7twoe & sh=36f545db53d9 cop26 climate conference opened monday ( 1 november ) , 50 private jet landed glasgow edinburgh airport , ferrying passenger one critical environmental summit history . run-up event , 118 different business jet flew airport , according data compiled wingx , aviation consultancy . overall , inbound private jet glasgow edinburgh airport 525 % opening day summit compared previous seven day . taking private jet cop24 include jeff bezos , prince charles boris johnson , criticized flying back london attend dinner wednesday evening . others made exit cannes south france , bern switzerland , according flight tracked flightradar24 . private jet , far , inefficient way travel , many pointed hypocrisy turning summit climate change something contributing cause . 118 private jet cop26 flew average three hour event would put combined carbon emitted 118 private jet 1,400 ton . â€œ research found journey could easily completed scheduled flight . private jet prestigious difficult avoid hypocrisy using one claiming fighting climate change , â€ say matt finch , u.k. policy manager transport environment campaign group . flying private jet glasgow rome , many leader previously attending g20 summit , emits roughly six ton co2 per flight , though estimate vary according aircraft weight ."

943,22/7/2023,TNanomaly EndTN,"One reason why we often see aerosol trail shadows: The shadow of the aerosol trail being dispersed by the Geoenginerring SAl aircraft/drone that is seen cast on the artificial synthetic reflective greenhouse above it, is due to the albedo effect. What this means is that, a synthetic cover over a region is created. This cover works as a magnifying glass, which allows UV/IR light spectrum to pass through, one-way, down to earths
surface. The UV/IR light spectrum is amplified by this cover as well. Once the UVs/IR reaches earth, through albedo, the UVs/IR spectrum light is reflected by earthâ€™s surface, back upward. The synthetic greenhouse reflective cover, then reflects the albedo, back to earth.

Essentially, the magnified Uv/IR spectrum light is trapped, bouncing back and forth, between earthâ€™s surface and the synthetic reflective cover, over and over again. This geoengineering method is called Solar Radiation Magnification Management/SRMM. This amplified radiation, not only increases surface and atmospheric temperatures, but is highly dangerous to all living organisms. We are being intentionally exposed to high levels of UVs/IR's spectrum, far beyond what is naturally produced by the sun, as well as extreme levels of radiation, far exceeding the threshold of any
living organisms spectrum requirements.

The thermal energy radiated by a greybody radiator, like Earth, per second per unit area, is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute  temperature and is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, below.

If the Earthâ€™s temperature is somehow increased, then the thermal energy radiated will be higher, per the S-B law.
If the energy radiated is higher, then the planet will cool faster, to a  point of radiative equilibrium, where the rate of outgoing radiation is equal to the incoming radiation.

This is a constraint that causes the Sun to effectively dictate the Earthâ€™s temperature, because even if  Earth warms (assuming for argument's sake under constant solar  irradiation), it will cool quickly, at the speed of light, to equal the incoming radiation.

The only way CO2 might warm the planet is if it  changes Earth's emissivity, e, and we do not yet have a theory that quantitatively explicates that.

CO2 does not create energy, it only absorbs and passes it by either re-emission or conductive transfer in  collisions with other molecules.

Other processes, such as geothermal energy, driven by nuclear fission reactions in Earth's core from heavier, radioactive molecules that sank during the early period of history when Earth was substantially molten, are now energy sources, and are appended to the outward radiating energy.

Still other processes, such as endothermic photosynthetic reactions, consumer energy and solar irradiation and thus lock-up thermal energy, sometimes for millions of years, as have fossil remains from the Carboniferous Period, or phytoplankton ""snow"" falling in the oceans to become sediment, in this case reducing the outward radiating energy from Earth.

CO2 lags earth temperature changes by 600-800 years, not the other way round. The CO2 causing climate change narrative is a hoax, climate change causes CO2 change instead, because the CO2 is emitted by the ocean, which acts as a temperature dependent carbon sink. 

The temperature of the Earth is instead dependent on the Sun: the orbital Earth-Sun distance is not constant  even in the medium term (Solar Inertial Motion ). The long term orbital change is also because of the Milankovitch Cycles :
1. The shape of Earthâ€™s orbit:Â eccentricity ;
2. The angle Earthâ€™s axis tilted with respect to Earthâ€™s orbital plane:Â obliquity ; and
3. The direction Earthâ€™s axis of rotation is pointed towards:Â precession .

But you donâ€™t know which way was chosen to achieve carbon neutral - as long as the total sum is the same as the amount of carbon emissions that you caused, he added. So it might be the case that a company did not do anything to eliminate emissions, but solely bought certificates to compensate for those emissions. That would still result in a carbon neutral banner, Lippert said.

In contrast to that, net-zero takes the compensation part out of this equation and puts a lot more emphasis on the elimination (avoidance) part, Lippert explained. It usually means that you first try to eliminate as many carbon emissions as possible - and neutralize (remove later) the remaining emissions that you canâ€™t eliminate, he said.""

1108,8/6/2023,Henry,"*epistle of a climate skeptic*

Dear All,Â 

Let me stick to simple one-liners for easy digestion,Â for anyone who is willingÂ to understand.Â 

Let's see how empathic and compassionate  you proclaim yourselves to be.Â I am a human being too, even though I do not share the same world view.

I will use the coaching structure of emotions, cognitive bias, and implementation.Â  Â 

For now, I will spare this group from citingÂ sourcesÂ to edify my points, and touch base with you on a more personal and social basis.Â  

Emotions 

 I have felt prosecutedÂ by environmentalism ever since I was a captive audience in school.Â 

I have been told, unless I inconvenienceÂ myself a little bit more, suffer a little bit more, pay a littleÂ bit more, then I may have a chanceÂ to save the world.Â 

There is no way around it, unless I agree and repeat what I am told, if not I am a bad person.Â 

I believed in the climateÂ crisis at that point in my life. I found myself expectant of disasters.

As time passed, I observed that human life as we know it was getting better. I was disappointed.Â 

The cognitiveÂ dissonanceÂ comes from two prongs: 1. expecting hopefully for bad things to happen. 2. Things did not happen as I was warned.Â 
Disappointment comes from both failed expectations and the feeling of being lied too.

I have not met all the environmentalists. There are many individuals in the world. But I can safelyÂ say that each environmentalist had decided somewhere long ago to be part of the bullies instead of being bullied.Â 

ImplementationÂ  

 Unfortunately for you, there are people like me who will stand up to bullying and intimidation.Â 

UnfortunatelyÂ for you, there are people like me who have the courage to think independently and critically. Therefore, I do my research and speak publicly against this ideology.Â 

There is no way that you can intimidate the whole worldÂ to repeat the same lie in order to make it true.Â 

There is no way you can enlargeÂ your echo chamber to the size of our atmosphere.Â 

I will speak up.Â 

Cognitive Biases 

 Do you really believeÂ yourself to be the underdogs? You have big corporations, global media, and governmentsÂ on your side for the message. You even have oil companies apologising to you, when they should have been heroes. whatever kind of fantasy bias this is, you better check it.

Do you really believeÂ that group thinking biases are really on the side of skeptics? I was told byÂ Marine before the session that she will not discuss the effectiveness of the individual action of reducing plastic straws. Not even cumulatively.Â 

Do you really believe that authorityÂ bias is on the side of people you disagree with? The more you utter the letters I P C C, the lesser you can explain the climate. The more you cite the ""scientific community"", the less you actually participate in scientific thinking. The more you say ""believeÂ the science"" the closer you are in practising scientology.Â 

None of your problems today are caused by fossil fuels, whatever bad effects of fossil fuels are all abundantly and exceedingly over compensated by its advantages to your material life. By many folds. Please check this false belief. Please be honest and not be deliberately obtuse.Â 

My implementationÂ to you 

 If you want to be healed of your climate anxiety, then you have to throw away the climate idols. Come to me, I will give you the full context narrative and facts, so that you can live a mentally healthy life.Â 

I learnt in my time in services and sales, that there are nice people and people with the skills to be nice. Likewise, you can apply coaching skills, speaking skills, facilitation skills to an evil ideology, it still wont yield healthy results.Â Â 

Realise that poor countries need to suffer your carbon taxes and ESG, because you want to feel good.Â 

Realise that poor people in rich countries need to suffer your carbon taxes and ESG, because you want to feel good.Â 

Just becauseÂ you care about the environment and that you believe in a crisis, someone else must pay for your gullibility.Â  Â ","* epistle climate skeptic * dear , let stick simple one-liner easy digestion , anyone willing understand . let 's see empathic compassionate proclaim . human , even though share world view . use coaching structure emotion , cognitive bias , implementation . , spare group citing source edify point , touch base personal social basis . emotion felt prosecuted environmentalism ever since captive audience school . told , unless inconvenience little bit , suffer little bit , pay little bit , may chance save world . way around , unless agree repeat told , bad person . believed climate crisis point life . found expectant disaster . time passed , observed human life know getting better . disappointed . cognitive dissonance come two prong : 1. expecting hopefully bad thing happen . 2. thing happen warned . disappointment come failed expectation feeling lied . met environmentalist . many individual world . safely say environmentalist decided somewhere long ago part bully instead bullied . implementation unfortunately , people like stand bullying intimidation . unfortunately , people like courage think independently critically . therefore , research speak publicly ideology . way intimidate whole world repeat lie order make true . way enlarge echo chamber size atmosphere . speak . cognitive bias really believe underdog ? big corporation , global medium , government side message . even oil company apologising , hero . whatever kind fantasy bias , better check . really believe group thinking bias really side skeptic ? told marine session discus effectiveness individual action reducing plastic straw . even cumulatively . really believe authority bias side people disagree ? utter letter p c c , lesser explain climate . cite `` scientific community '' , le actually participate scientific thinking . say `` believe science '' closer practising scientology . none problem today caused fossil fuel , whatever bad effect fossil fuel abundantly exceedingly compensated advantage material life . many fold . please check false belief . please honest deliberately obtuse . implementation want healed climate anxiety , throw away climate idol . come , give full context narrative fact , live mentally healthy life . learnt time service sale , nice people people skill nice . likewise , apply coaching skill , speaking skill , facilitation skill evil ideology , still wont yield healthy result . realise poor country need suffer carbon tax esg , want feel good . realise poor people rich country need suffer carbon tax esg , want feel good . care environment believe crisis , someone else must pay gullibility ."

""The complex dynamics of solar activity appear to be characterized by a number of oscillations ranging from monthly to multimillennial timescales, the most well-known of which being the 11-year Schwabe sunspot cycle. Solar oscillations are important because they also characterize the oscillations observed in Earthâ€™s climate and can thus be used to explain and forecast climate changes. Thus, it is important to investigate the physical origin of solar oscillations. There appear to be two possibilities: either the oscillations in solar activity are exclusively controlled by internal solar dynamo mechanisms, or the solar dynamo is partially synchronized to planetary frequencies by planetary forcings. The latter concept has recently gained support from a growing amount of evidence. In this work, we provide an overview of the many empirical facts that would support a planetary hypothesis of the variability of solar activity and emphasize their importance for climate research. We show that the frequencies produced by the complex interactions of all of the planets are coherent with the major solar activity and climate cycles, from monthly to multimillennial timescales, including the well-known Schwabe 11-year solar cycle. We provide some persuasive theoretical and empirical support for the planetary hypothesis of solar and climate variability.""

Itâ€™s an old fear that dates back to the grim prophecies of the 18th-century English cleric and economist Thomas Malthus, who wrote that â€œthe power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.â€

cold deaths are a statistical correlation (like smoking causes cancer)

Just as the deadly remedies proposed to solve those fake crises of pandemics have always been the objective of Imperial Collegeâ€™s fraud, so too has the remedy of â€œdecarbonizationâ€ of industrial civilization been the deadly goal behind the war on global warming which computer models have convinced the world is the primary existential threat to humanity since 1972. Just like the WHOâ€™s demands that national sovereignty be cancelled in order for â€œthe greater goodâ€ to be defended by a supranational medical regime, the same argument for a world government has been championed by supporters of the man-made global warming thesis for over 50 years. For those unfamiliar with the facts of the computer generated chimera of â€œman-made global warmingâ€, I refer you to my recent essay In Defense of CO2: Astro-Climatology, Climategate and Common Sense Revisited.

Today, those â€œsolutionsâ€ take the form of Agenda 2030, which pushes for the deconstruction of industrial civilization, the shutdown of agriculture, fossil fuels and the shackling of nations to inefficient forms of energy like windmills, solar panels and biofuels in order to ostensibly save nature from humanity.

In spite of all of the evidence to demonstrate that neither covid-19 nor man-made global warming have any existence beyond the predictive computer models programmed to scare us into believing they do, it is worth asking: How have so many seemingly educated people become persuaded that COVID-19 or climate change are so existentially dangerous that we must shut down the world economy to somehow save ourselves from their supposedly apocalyptic effects?""

Over 90 percent of Sri Lankaâ€™s farmers had used chemical fertilizers before they were banned. After they were banned, an astonishing 85 percent experienced crop losses. Rice production fell 20 percent and prices skyrocketed 50 percent in just six months. Sri Lanka had to import $450 million worth of rice despite having been self-sufficient just months earlier.

""Technocracyâ€™s plan was to replace the price system with a system based on energy. In the 1920s, Scott and his colleagues began a hugely ambitious program called the Energy Survey of North America. The idea was to establish a value for all the goods and services produced on the continent, not by measuring how much labour was expended or how much money was spent, but on the amount of energy used to produce them.

They would then divide the total amount of energy used by the number of citizens in the Technate over the age of 25, and issue each of those citizens an equal number of Energy Certificates, whether they were employed or not. These certificates would be the Technateâ€™s currency.

Every time you bought something, some of your energy credits would be deducted, and because the certificates would be issued directly to the owner, they couldnâ€™t be bought, sold, traded or stolen. No one would be able to accumulate more than anyone else. It was a prescription for a radically egalitarian state that might have made a Bolshevik blush.

In the Technate, your work life wouldnâ€™t begin until age 25. Once you joined the labour force, youâ€™d work 16 hours a week, youâ€™d get about 78 days of vacation a year and youâ€™d retire when youâ€™re 45.

Only a small percentage of adults in the Technate would have jobs, and Scott thought that should be a cause for celebration. Most of those â€œhand toolâ€ jobs were not very good to begin with, so why weep if they could now be done by a machine? People who clung to old-fashioned ideas about the value of work were â€œsuckers.â€""

Most humans are naturally repulsed by insects. The mere sight of some types of bugs generates in most people an instant feeling of disgust, while some succumb to outright panic and horror.

Our natural inclination to yell â€œNOPEâ€ when a bug is anywhere near us could be our brains warning us that these things could bite, sting, infect or even poison us to death. Considering the fact that some insects feed on filth, decay, and excrement, the mere sight of them is enough for our brains to send an alarm signal telling us that something is wrong.

To fully understand why the elite wants us to eat bugs, we must first wrap our heads around one important fact: Theyâ€™re looking to redefine what it means to be a human on Earth. They believe that we have too many freedoms and that we consume too many resources.","elite desperately trying convince eat bug . â€™ . http : //beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2022/09/the-elite-is-desperately-trying-to-convince-you-to-eat-bugs-heres-why-3781121.html human naturally repulsed insect . mere sight type bug generates people instant feeling disgust , succumb outright panic horror . natural inclination yell â€œ nope â€ bug anywhere near u could brain warning u thing could bite , sting , infect even poison u death . considering fact insect feed filth , decay , excrement , mere sight enough brain send alarm signal telling u something wrong . fully understand elite want u eat bug , must first wrap head around one important fact : â€™ looking redefine mean human earth . believe many freedom consume many resource ."

In 2021, it takes less than a third of an acre.â€

Thatâ€™s all thanks to diesel power.

 ""On May 26th, Aspire Food Group announced that it has completed construction of its alternative protein manufacturing facility. London, Ontario is now home to the worldâ€™s largest cricket production facility.

Aspireâ€™s new plant will reportedly produce 9000 metric tons of crickets every year for human and pet consumption. Thatâ€™s about two billion insects to be distributed annually across Canada and throughout the United States.

Aspire also reports that it already has orders for the next two years.

Crickets are currently being explored as a protein-rich superfood. They contain fibre and are already found in grocery stores and restaurants, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional protein sources.""

It's common sense that you don't lower energy production until you've built a suitable replacement.

America's carbon emissions peaked in 2005 and have continued to go down ever since.

We should be building nuclear plants, drilling for oil, and creating an abundance of energy right now to bring down inflation and lower the cost of living.

China is wisely building a record number of nuclear and coal plants and increasing oil and gas production in 2022.

- Food Compass rates Frosted Mini Wheats as three times healthier than ground beef, with a score of 87 out of 100, compared to 26 for ground beef
- Food Compass also gives high scores to fries, Lucky Charms, Honey Nut Cheerios, chocolate covered almonds and almond M&Ms, while rating whole egg fried in butter, cheddar cheese and ground beef as foods that should be avoided. Based on this tool, youâ€™ll be healthier if you replace whole egg, cheddar cheese and ground beef with candy
- Studies have repeatedly shown that diets high in processed foods lead to poor health and depression, and the more processed your diet is, the greater your risk of obesity and chronic diseases that shave years, if not decades, off your life span
- Health, food security, independence and freedom are what the global elitists, led by the World Economic Forum, intend to destroy so that they can then roll out a new food system based entirely on patented, processed imitation foods, including lab-grown and plant- or fungi-based â€œmeatsâ€ and â€œclean, greenâ€ protein alternatives such as cricket meal and mealworms

The move sets a new gold standard for carbon neutrality reporting in the wake of calls for more rigorous systems following COP26.

As organizations across the world struggle to navigate the complexities of carbon reporting, MVGX, a digital green exchange licensed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, designed a proof-of-concept system to calculate and verify its own carbon neutrality in order to demonstrate the value that blockchain technology can deliver.
