The move sets a new gold standard for carbon neutrality reporting in the wake of calls for more rigorous systems following COP26.

As organizations across the world struggle to navigate the complexities of carbon reporting, MVGX, a digital green exchange licensed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, designed a proof-of-concept system to calculate and verify its own carbon neutrality in order to demonstrate the value that blockchain technology can deliver.

Leveraging BSI's methodology to accurately verify carbon neutrality, MVGX was able to offset its carbon footprint precisely using its Carbon Neutrality Token (CNTTM). Enabled by proprietary protocols and blockchain technology, CNTTMs combine the immutability of NFTs with real-time data updates, offering an immutable and continuously updated record of carbon performance.""

We are about to enter an age of radical transparency.  I have been among those who have formed a new coalition called ‘Climate TRACE’…Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions.  It’s a coalition of artificial intelligence technology companies, NGOs, and universities, using data from 300 existing satellites from multiple countries, ground, sea and air-based censors, and internet data streams, to use machine-learning to create algorithms for every single sub-sector of the economy.” This colossal data-collection project aims to replace the current self-reporting system of greenhouse gas emissions by countries and companies, who have committed to net zero goals, by publishing reports of climate offenders so that countries, companies, and even individuals can be “held accountable.”  The Google-backed AI algorithm used by Climate TRACE appears to lay the framework for enforcing ESG initiatives heavily pushed by financial behemoths such as BlackRock, as well as a technocratic social and climate credit system.""

“The real agenda behind that is that they want to have a stick to beat the farmers with and it’s not just to facilitate the continuous immigration,” but the broader and “spiritual” agenda is to end the farmers’ connection to their land and traditions, said Baudet.

- Food Compass rates Frosted Mini Wheats as three times healthier than ground beef, with a score of 87 out of 100, compared to 26 for ground beef
- Food Compass also gives high scores to fries, Lucky Charms, Honey Nut Cheerios, chocolate covered almonds and almond M&Ms, while rating whole egg fried in butter, cheddar cheese and ground beef as foods that should be avoided. Based on this tool, you’ll be healthier if you replace whole egg, cheddar cheese and ground beef with candy
- Studies have repeatedly shown that diets high in processed foods lead to poor health and depression, and the more processed your diet is, the greater your risk of obesity and chronic diseases that shave years, if not decades, off your life span
- Health, food security, independence and freedom are what the global elitists, led by the World Economic Forum, intend to destroy so that they can then roll out a new food system based entirely on patented, processed imitation foods, including lab-grown and plant- or fungi-based “meats” and “clean, green” protein alternatives such as cricket meal and mealworms

It's common sense that you don't lower energy production until you've built a suitable replacement.

America's carbon emissions peaked in 2005 and have continued to go down ever since.

We should be building nuclear plants, drilling for oil, and creating an abundance of energy right now to bring down inflation and lower the cost of living.

China is wisely building a record number of nuclear and coal plants and increasing oil and gas production in 2022.

They blow up the effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, but ignore any beneficial effects. “CO2 is not a pollutant,” it says. “It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth; additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yield of crops worldwide.”

In addition, the scientists declare that there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and such-like natural disasters, or making them more frequent. “There is no climate emergency,” the Declaration goes on. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050,” it says, adding that the aim of global policy should be “prosperity for all” by providing reliable and affordable energy at all times. “In a prosperous society, men and women are well educated, birth rates are low and people care about their environment,” it concludes.""

In 2021, it takes less than a third of an acre.”

That’s all thanks to diesel power.

And five of those ten acres went toward feeding mules and horses. Today, one gallon of diesel replaces 500 man-hours of labor. And that, says Loos, is the real reason for the attack on fossil fuels. “With fuel, we can continually get through the efficiency of producing more food with fewer inputs,” he said. “Without fuel, we go back to the horse-and-buggy days, which is a regression of 100 years.”""

The coalition includes 30 different groups and institutions merged to investigate how to leverage Web3 tech like cryptocurrencies and blockchain to help the world become carbon neutral.

“An important and unique aspect of Web3 is that it uses technology to support and reward direct community engagement and action,” said WEF head of digital assets Brynly Llyr.

The coalition will examine how to add “carbon credits” to the blockchain. Partners include Accenture, the Crypto Council for Innovation, Rainforest Partnership, the Sustainable Bitcoin Standard, Zero Labs and others.""

""Technocracy’s plan was to replace the price system with a system based on energy. In the 1920s, Scott and his colleagues began a hugely ambitious program called the Energy Survey of North America. The idea was to establish a value for all the goods and services produced on the continent, not by measuring how much labour was expended or how much money was spent, but on the amount of energy used to produce them.

They would then divide the total amount of energy used by the number of citizens in the Technate over the age of 25, and issue each of those citizens an equal number of Energy Certificates, whether they were employed or not. These certificates would be the Technate’s currency.

Every time you bought something, some of your energy credits would be deducted, and because the certificates would be issued directly to the owner, they couldn’t be bought, sold, traded or stolen. No one would be able to accumulate more than anyone else. It was a prescription for a radically egalitarian state that might have made a Bolshevik blush.

In the Technate, your work life wouldn’t begin until age 25. Once you joined the labour force, you’d work 16 hours a week, you’d get about 78 days of vacation a year and you’d retire when you’re 45.

Only a small percentage of adults in the Technate would have jobs, and Scott thought that should be a cause for celebration.

What they did was they put Europe in an incredibly fragile position... 

[President Trump's] language turned people off even though the message that he was delivering was 100% right. When Trump went to the United Nations, he was clear, he was precise, and in hindsight, and I'm saying this as a Democrat, he was right about the German reliance on Russian gas and the European reliance...

Just as the deadly remedies proposed to solve those fake crises of pandemics have always been the objective of Imperial College’s fraud, so too has the remedy of “decarbonization” of industrial civilization been the deadly goal behind the war on global warming which computer models have convinced the world is the primary existential threat to humanity since 1972. Just like the WHO’s demands that national sovereignty be cancelled in order for “the greater good” to be defended by a supranational medical regime, the same argument for a world government has been championed by supporters of the man-made global warming thesis for over 50 years. For those unfamiliar with the facts of the computer generated chimera of “man-made global warming”, I refer you to my recent essay In Defense of CO2: Astro-Climatology, Climategate and Common Sense Revisited.

Today, those “solutions” take the form of Agenda 2030, which pushes for the deconstruction of industrial civilization, the shutdown of agriculture, fossil fuels and the shackling of nations to inefficient forms of energy like windmills, solar panels and biofuels in order to ostensibly save nature from humanity.

In spite of all of the evidence to demonstrate that neither covid-19 nor man-made global warming have any existence beyond the predictive computer models programmed to scare us into believing they do, it is worth asking: How have so many seemingly educated people become persuaded that COVID-19 or climate change are so existentially dangerous that we must shut down the world economy to somehow save ourselves from their supposedly apocalyptic effects?""

> The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework calls for digital genetic sequencing of all species, including humans, to be stored as a global common asset and made available for licensing by the biotechnology industry.

“No modelling expects prices of €45 – we more likely have €100 to €300,” Flachsland said.

A carbon price of €200 equates to a price surcharge of 53 cents per litre of diesel and 47 cents per litre of petrol.

In extreme cases, if EU countries do not take any additional climate policy measures but rely entirely on carbon pricing to reduce emissions, “we find a range from €175 to €350 per tonne [of CO2] across different modelling approaches,” Pahle said.""

""The complex dynamics of solar activity appear to be characterized by a number of oscillations ranging from monthly to multimillennial timescales, the most well-known of which being the 11-year Schwabe sunspot cycle. Solar oscillations are important because they also characterize the oscillations observed in Earth’s climate and can thus be used to explain and forecast climate changes. Thus, it is important to investigate the physical origin of solar oscillations. There appear to be two possibilities: either the oscillations in solar activity are exclusively controlled by internal solar dynamo mechanisms, or the solar dynamo is partially synchronized to planetary frequencies by planetary forcings. The latter concept has recently gained support from a growing amount of evidence. In this work, we provide an overview of the many empirical facts that would support a planetary hypothesis of the variability of solar activity and emphasize their importance for climate research. We show that the frequencies produced by the complex interactions of all of the planets are coherent with the major solar activity and climate cycles, from monthly to multimillennial timescales, including the well-known Schwabe 11-year solar cycle. We provide some persuasive theoretical and empirical support for the planetary hypothesis of solar and climate variability.""

Dear All, 

Let me stick to simple one-liners for easy digestion, for anyone who is willing to understand. 

Let's see how empathic and compassionate  you proclaim yourselves to be. I am a human being too, even though I do not share the same world view.

I will use the coaching structure of emotions, cognitive bias, and implementation.   

For now, I will spare this group from citing sources to edify my points, and touch base with you on a more personal and social basis.  

Emotions 

 I have felt prosecuted by environmentalism ever since I was a captive audience in school. 

I have been told, unless I inconvenience myself a little bit more, suffer a little bit more, pay a little bit more, then I may have a chance to save the world. 

There is no way around it, unless I agree and repeat what I am told, if not I am a bad person. 

I believed in the climate crisis at that point in my life. I found myself expectant of disasters.

As time passed, I observed that human life as we know it was getting better. I was disappointed. 

The cognitive dissonance comes from two prongs: 1. expecting hopefully for bad things to happen. 2. Things did not happen as I was warned. 
Disappointment comes from both failed expectations and the feeling of being lied too.

I have not met all the environmentalists. There are many individuals in the world. But I can safely say that each environmentalist had decided somewhere long ago to be part of the bullies instead of being bullied. 

Implementation  

 Unfortunately for you, there are people like me who will stand up to bullying and intimidation. 

Unfortunately for you, there are people like me who have the courage to think independently and critically. Therefore, I do my research and speak publicly against this ideology. 

There is no way that you can intimidate the whole world to repeat the same lie in order to make it true. 

There is no way you can enlarge your echo chamber to the size of our atmosphere. 

I will speak up. 

Cognitive Biases 

 Do you really believe yourself to be the underdogs? You have big corporations, global media, and governments on your side for the message. You even have oil companies apologising to you, when they should have been heroes. whatever kind of fantasy bias this is, you better check it.

Do you really believe that group thinking biases are really on the side of skeptics? I was told by Marine before the session that she will not discuss the effectiveness of the individual action of reducing plastic straws. Not even cumulatively. 

Do you really believe that authority bias is on the side of people you disagree with? The more you utter the letters I P C C, the lesser you can explain the climate. The more you cite the ""scientific community"", the less you actually participate in scientific thinking. The more you say ""believe the science"" the closer you are in practising scientology. 

None of your problems today are caused by fossil fuels, whatever bad effects of fossil fuels are all abundantly and exceedingly over compensated by its advantages to your material life. By many folds. Please check this false belief. Please be honest and not be deliberately obtuse. 

My implementation to you 

 If you want to be healed of your climate anxiety, then you have to throw away the climate idols. Come to me, I will give you the full context narrative and facts, so that you can live a mentally healthy life. 

I learnt in my time in services and sales, that there are nice people and people with the skills to be nice. Likewise, you can apply coaching skills, speaking skills, facilitation skills to an evil ideology, it still wont yield healthy results.  

Realise that poor countries need to suffer your carbon taxes and ESG, because you want to feel good. 

Realise that poor people in rich countries need to suffer your carbon taxes and ESG, because you want to feel good. 

Just because you care about the environment and that you believe in a crisis, someone else must pay for your gullibility.   ",,True,"[Tree('PERSON', [('Dear', 'NNP'), ('All', 'NNP')])]","['Dear All', 'one', 'two', '1', '2.', 'somewhere long ago', 'Marine', 'I P C C', 'today', 'ESG', 'ESG']","Sentiment(polarity=0.08674799465240642, subjectivity=0.5053746498599441)"

So it might be the case that a company did not do anything to eliminate emissions, but solely bought certificates to compensate for those emissions. That would still result in a carbon neutral banner, Lippert said.

In contrast to that, net-zero takes the compensation part out of this equation and puts a lot more emphasis on the elimination (avoidance) part, Lippert explained. It usually means that you first try to eliminate as many carbon emissions as possible - and neutralize (remove later) the remaining emissions that you can’t eliminate, he said.""

CO2 lags earth temperature changes by 600-800 years, not the other way round. The CO2 causing climate change narrative is a hoax, climate change causes CO2 change instead, because the CO2 is emitted by the ocean, which acts as a temperature dependent carbon sink. 

The temperature of the Earth is instead dependent on the Sun: the orbital Earth-Sun distance is not constant  even in the medium term (Solar Inertial Motion ). The long term orbital change is also because of the Milankovitch Cycles :
1. The shape of Earth’s orbit: eccentricity ;
2. The angle Earth’s axis tilted with respect to Earth’s orbital plane: obliquity ; and
3. The direction Earth’s axis of rotation is pointed towards: precession .

The thermal energy radiated by a greybody radiator, like Earth, per second per unit area, is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute  temperature and is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, below.

If the Earth’s temperature is somehow increased, then the thermal energy radiated will be higher, per the S-B law.
If the energy radiated is higher, then the planet will cool faster, to a  point of radiative equilibrium, where the rate of outgoing radiation is equal to the incoming radiation.

This is a constraint that causes the Sun to effectively dictate the Earth’s temperature, because even if  Earth warms (assuming for argument's sake under constant solar  irradiation), it will cool quickly, at the speed of light, to equal the incoming radiation.

The only way CO2 might warm the planet is if it  changes Earth's emissivity, e, and we do not yet have a theory that quantitatively explicates that.

CO2 does not create energy, it only absorbs and passes it by either re-emission or conductive transfer in  collisions with other molecules.

Other processes, such as geothermal energy, driven by nuclear fission reactions in Earth's core from heavier, radioactive molecules that sank during the early period of history when Earth was substantially molten, are now energy sources, and are appended to the outward radiating energy.

Still other processes, such as endothermic photosynthetic reactions, consumer energy and solar irradiation and thus lock-up thermal energy, sometimes for millions of years, as have fossil remains from the Carboniferous Period, or phytoplankton ""snow"" falling in the oceans to become sediment, in this case reducing the outward radiating energy from Earth.

What this means is that, a synthetic cover over a region is created. This cover works as a magnifying glass, which allows UV/IR light spectrum to pass through, one-way, down to earths
surface. The UV/IR light spectrum is amplified by this cover as well. Once the UVs/IR reaches earth, through albedo, the UVs/IR spectrum light is reflected by earth’s surface, back upward. The synthetic greenhouse reflective cover, then reflects the albedo, back to earth.

Essentially, the magnified Uv/IR spectrum light is trapped, bouncing back and forth, between earth’s surface and the synthetic reflective cover, over and over again. This geoengineering method is called Solar Radiation Magnification Management/SRMM. This amplified radiation, not only increases surface and atmospheric temperatures, but is highly dangerous to all living organisms. We are being intentionally exposed to high levels of UVs/IR's spectrum, far beyond what is naturally produced by the sun, as well as extreme levels of radiation, far exceeding the threshold of any

They are trying to paint a picture of an earth and atmosphere that is crumbling due to our way of life.

It’s all happening right on schedule. It’s almost like Bill Gates himself—who pretended to be an expert in infectious disease—scripted it with his sudden knowledge of climate change. His book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” came out in 2021 almost as a road map into how to keep the panic going and the state growing. And sure enough, here we are, with nearly every headline in every major paper in the English-speaking world going on about how the world is baking due to fossil fuels and too much freedom.""

As the COP26 climate conference opened on Monday (1 November), 50 private jets landed at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, ferrying their passengers to one of the most critical environmental summits in history.


In the run-up to the event, 118 different business jets flew into the airports, according to data compiled by WingX, an aviation consultancy. Overall, inbound private jets to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports were up 525% on the opening day of the summit compared with the previous seven days.

Those taking private jets to and from COP24 include Jeff Bezos, Prince Charles and Boris Johnson, who was criticized for flying back to London to attend a dinner on Wednesday evening. Others made an exit to Cannes in the South of France, and Bern in Switzerland, according to flights tracked by FlightRadar24.

Private jets are, by far, the most inefficient way to travel, and many have pointed out the hypocrisy of turning up to a summit on climate change on something that is contributing to its very cause.

If all 118 private jets at COP26 flew an average of three hours to and from the event that would put the combined carbon emitted by the 118 private jets at over 1,400 tons.

“Our research has found that most journeys could easily be completed on scheduled flights. Private jets are very prestigious but it is difficult to avoid the hypocrisy of using one while claiming to be fighting climate change,” says Matt Finch, U.K. policy manager at the Transport and Environment campaign group.

Flying a private jet between Glasgow and Rome, where many leaders were previously attending the G20 summit, emits roughly six tons of CO2 per flight, though estimates vary according to aircraft and weight.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/11/05/118-private-jets-take-leaders-to-cop26-climate-summit-burning-over-1000-tons-of-co2/?fbclid=IwAR2j-yriXcHM209Kz8DnqMc3o0w9hpqwygbN7rAje8a6MyQRm-t53F7TWOE&sh=36f545db53d9 ,True,"[Tree('ORGANIZATION', [('COP26', 'NNP')]), Tree('ORGANIZATION', [('Glasgow', 'NNP')]), Tree('ORGANIZATION', [('Edinburgh', 'NNP')])]","['Monday', '1 November', '50', 'Glasgow', 'Edinburgh', '118', 'Glasgow', 'Edinburgh', '525%', 'the opening day', 'the previous seven days', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Prince Charles', 'Boris Johnson', 'London', 'Wednesday', 'evening', 'Cannes', 'France', 'Bern', 'Switzerland', '118', 'three hours', '118', 'over 1,400 tons', 'Matt Finch', 'U.K.', 'Glasgow', 'Rome', 'G20', 'roughly six tons']","Sentiment(polarity=0.09038461538461541, subjectivity=0.441025641025641)"

Singapore's accounts for 0.2 % of global emission. Even if all world governments are competent enough to impose the Paris agreement, it would only amount to reducing global emission by 1%.

This series of wildfires began in the spring and the causes are being blamed on the narrative of man-made climate change. 

Mac Isaac is not afraid to openly express his personal opinion on this and has already had to suffer reprisals from the Canadian government, which has censored his expressions of opinion. This dictatorial approach of the government to suppress freedom of expression is reminiscent of the harsh persecution of the ""Truckers for Freedom"" movement in the so-called ""Corona Pandemic"", when many courageous people rebelled against the incipient totalitarianism in Canada.

But while the sums are impressive on their face, they represent just a fraction of the estimated $400bn some estimate will be needed to clean and protect the nation’s drinking water. Orange county, California, alone put the cost of cleaning its system at $1bn.

“While over a billion dollars is real money, it is a virtual drop in the bucket of potential utility costs to monitor, remove and dispose of these contaminants in accordance with anticipated federal regulations,” the American Municipal Water Association trade group said in a statement.

Moreover, the two settlements include just over 6,000 water systems nationwide. Utilities that were not part of the suits but have PFAS in their systems can claim some of the settlement money, or they can sue the chemical manufacturers on their own.

That means the settlements only represent the first wave of utility lawsuits to hit chemical manufacturers, legal observers say. Because PFAS are so widely used and the scale of their harm is so great, chemical makers will get hit from a range of legal angles, and some suspect the industry’s final bill could exceed the $200bn paid by big tobacco in the 1990s.""

_“The popular narrative about climate change reflects a dangerous corruption of science that threatens the world’s economy and the well-being of billions of people._ 

_Misguided climate science has metastasized into massive shock-journalistic pseudoscience. In turn the pseudoscience has become a scapegoat for a wide variety of other unrelated ills. It has been promoted and extended by similarly misguided business marketing agents, politicians, journalists, government agencies, and environmentalists._

Even a healthy young person will die after enduring six hours of 35°C warmth when coupled with 100 per cent humidity, but new research shows that the threshold could be significantly lower.

“Citing extensive data to support their case, William Happer, professor emeritus in physics at Princeton University, and Richard Lindzen, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argued that the claims used by the EPA to justify the new regulations are not based on scientific facts but rather political opinions and speculative models that have consistently proven to be wrong. 

More CO2 in the atmosphere leads to more plant growth and higher farming yields, they argued. In addition, synthetic fertilizers, which are derivatives of natural gas, are responsible for nearly half the world’s food production today. ‘Net zero’ goals would reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40 gigatons per year, reducing the food supply proportionally, they said.”

PART 1 OF 2

 In 2015 the leaders of 193 countries signed their population up to Agenda 2030

What is Sustainable Development (SD)?
 SD is ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”

Core Principles: 

Universality  (all countries committed to whole Agenda regardless of any unique factors)

Leaving No One Behind  (all people will be included; “with unprecedented need for data to ensure this principle is met”)

Interconnectedness and Indivisibility  – no pick and mix approach to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – all to be followed

Inclusiveness  – the entire population must follow 

Multi Stakeholder Partnerships  – establishment seen as essential to deliver all SDG’s

Dimensions of the Agenda (the 5Ps)
 People, Prosperity, Planet, Partnership and Peace

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
 Used to focus on areas necessary to achieve SD

Each SDG has 8-12 targets & 1-4 indicators of progress 

SDG'S:

Goal 1:  End poverty 
Goal 2:  End hunger
Goal 3:  Ensure healthy lives 
Goal 4:  Quality education 
Goal 5:  Gender equality
Goal 6 : Water/sanitation for all
Goal 7:  Affordable clean energy for all
Goal 8:  Economic growth/full + productive employment 
Goal 9:  Resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization/innovation
Goal 10:  Reduce inequality within and among countries
Goal 11:  Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient & sustainable
Goal 12:  Ensure sustainable consumption + production patterns
Goal 13:  Combat climate change 
Goal 14:  Conserve/sustainably use oceans, seas & marine resources 
Goal 15:  Promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, deserts & land 
Goal 16:  Promote inclusive societies, access to justice + accountable institutions 
Goal 17:  Strengthen/revitalise the Global Partnership for SD

A world-renowned, Nobel Prize-winning scientist has joined hundreds of other leading experts and academics in signing the World Climate Declaration (WCD).
Dr. John Clauser has now officially put his name to the World Climate Declaration (WCD) which states that “there is no climate emergency.”
Clauser, who was also awarded the 2010 Wolf Prize in Physics, the second most prestigious physics award after the Nobel, warns that misguided climate science is a hoax that is being driven by “massive shock-journalistic pseudoscience.”

""General CO2-lag in ice-core records and the lack of warming over the last 8000 years of extraordinary increase in CO2 show that the hypothesis of significant warming of the atmosphere by CO2 over the last century is absurd. Attribution of derivative effects (i.e. “climate change”) to CO2 is, therefore, ridiculous. 
These fictions, the dire prophecies that attend them and the disparagement of those that question them, however, are vigorously promoted and widely accepted. They seem to be as important socially as they are false scientifically.
While recent snow at Vostok adds to the falsification of the hypothesis of “dangerous man-made climate change by carbon-dioxide, a powerful heat-trapping greenhouse-gas”, such falsification was evident in the ice-core data published in 1999 and has always been logically obvious to anyone with an understanding of the carbon cycle at the surface of the earth.
For distraction from abuse by the saviors of planets, polar bears, putative grandchildren, etc., those of us with some affection for natural science might consider what news from Vostok (or Dome Fuji or Dome C) would indicate that climate might be trending beyond the limits of the last 400000 years.""

WEF Caught Paying Arsonists To 'Burn Down the World' as Part of Sick Depopulation Plan

Far-left arsonists are engaged in a globalist plot to “burn down the world” according to a WEF insider who warns that humanity has been primed to fall for the globalist elite’s three-card trick.

The global elite laid the groundwork with the Covid pandemic, training the masses to be compliant, while pre-programming them with years of climate change propaganda in the media. As far as they are concerned, the wildfires are the final nail in our coffin.

Climate change is not only a hoax, it is a decades-old global depopulation plot, and WEF-infiltrated governments all over the world are going along with it.

The Government’s Energy Bill comes before the Commons when MPs return from their summer break on Tuesday.

Under the bill Ministers want to grant themselves powers to create new criminal offences  and increase civil penalties as part of efforts to hit NET ZERO.  

If you fall foul of regulations to reduce your energy consumption, you could face up to a year in prison and fines of up to £15,000.  You could also be prosecuted for “provision of false information” about energy efficiency or the “obstruction of an enforcement authority”.

This has to STOP.

Criminal offences are an exceptional use of state power. They require full constitutional scrutiny and should NEVER be introduced by a minister under secondary legislation.

Make sure your MP knows that you will not except the criminalisation of the use of energy as you see fit, to achieve net zero which you have not voted for.

We will be deep diving this bill over the coming weeks and intend to hold an online forum about it which you are welcome to join.

It's time to step up. Before we are all classed as criminals, locked up, and potentially lose our homes.

The reset WEF man has spoken: 
1)no agriculture to create famine (but lab grown meat and eat insects instead) 
2)he assumes higher CO2 = higher temp = no food (unscientific) 

Ice cores from North and South poles show that CO2 changes followed temperature changes by at least 200 years. 

Climatologists state that global temperatures are affected mainly by sun, ocean currents and volcanoes, …not the man made CO2 which accounts for 3% of the 0.04% of the air. 
When CO2 increases plants thrive and crops will yield more food. 

When net Zero is reached humans (made up of carbon) will be depopulated significantly due the collapse of agriculture and economies because green energy is very inefficient and expensive.

The NWO just keeps doubling down. But the stakes have risen considerably. Now the globalist construct is openly, yet subtly and cowardly, threatening to alter the global water supply. Humanity is facing sabotage of our currency, food, and water supplies. Yet everyone carries on as if this isn't a red alert emergency. Do not be deceived.

In the featured video, Bjorn Andreas Bull-Hansen, a best-selling Norwegian novelist, explains how the European Union’s ""Energy Performance of Buildings Directive"" — the legislative instrument that dictates the energy performance standards for buildings within the EU — will be used to achieve a massive wealth transfer scheme.

In March 2023, the EU Parliament voted to revise this directive as part of a ""Fit for 55"" package, which aims to meet a minimum 55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

By 2050, the EU intends to achieve a ""zero-emission and fully decarbonized building stock."" In short, by 2050, they want every building — commercial, public and residential — in the EU to meet zero-emission standards. To achieve that, they will impose a slew of new requirements on homeowners.

“The evidence is incontrovertible. Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security, and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.”

""The people in charge of some of the most powerful organizations on the planet have determined that agriculture, specifically animal agriculture is to blame for global warming, and global warming is to blame for the high prices of food as well as food shortages.

And so by switching our diets from beef, chicken and pork, to crickets and mealworms, we'll be able to stop temperatures from rising, lower the price of food and possibly to even save the planet.""

I did a very very high level analysis of the Malaysian market for a project, just to figure some basic maths from the limited information I had.  So if you own a pure EV car and you got a home charger given you could only get an 11KWh charger it would take about a day to charge.  So you would need to likely top up at a fast charger if you could find one and pay  min 3x or more the cost of electricity at home.  Then most of the chargers were built for hybrid battery/petrol where 11KWh makes sense and would barely make any dent charging a full EV for a few hours.  Then you have way more chargers than are needed for the number of car because they got to address range anxiety so most chargers are idle.  I would say most are making a loss with a 5 year min break-even.

Then if Asian markets follow the western markets where those who want one will buy one and then growth drops significantly.  I think that's why we all of a sudden saw hug uptake in the last few years.  The west EV growth slowed and they pushed growing excess supply to the east.

Then it takes the excavation of 50 tons of earth to make one battery.

Then they talk about recycling old batteries but we all know that will never happen as there is no money in it and any business doing it will lose money.  So EV graveyards leaking toxic waste into the environment.

The whole system revolves around the idea that the majority can be made to believe 𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠, so long as it is repeated loudly and often. And it works.

— NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden

Well worth a read, as it ties together principles of deception that apply to both main elements of the long-planned deception: civilisation-threatening human-caused climate change and global pandemics, both of which are flat lies.

While I’m no expert in climate science, I’m an adequate scientist and quite capable of understanding the published literature. Having spent months doing exactly that, I have found sufficient holes in the rather weak claims, very loudly made, that there’s a crisis related to climate change. Not only is this a lie, but release of CO2 is proven to be a minor factor in global temperature change and in fact follows temperature changes, not leads them. It therefore cannot be a major driver of climate change. This has been demonstrated beyond doubt decades ago. The rest is just lies. Scientists are no harder to buy that politicians.

An important video from Neil Oliver.

Perhaps the most important thing about it is this. 

That JFK wasn’t killed by a lone gunman but by an arrangement which involved US government actors (the CIA) and others is no longer even disputed by government spooks. Nobody is deplatformed for saying this. 

As Neil himself often says, “Here’s the thing”. This cannot be overstated.

Those who react to suggestions that there’s something going on behind the claimed pandemic or about the claimed human induced climate change crisis with cries of “Conspiracy theorist!” need to take a long, cool look at the last 60 years, at least.

What we have, even that far back in November 1963 in Dallas, Texas, is proof that senior elements in the US administration had no compunction in murdering an elected US President, for whatever reasons they had. The reasons are now immaterial in a sense, because it’s that murder of their fellow citizens is not a barrier for these people that is the key to what’s happening today.

One more thing. Blair lied to the British people and to parliament and the BBC aided & abetted him, in getting U.K. to join an illegal war in Iraq. He claimed that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch with notice no greater than 45 minutes. 

President Bush led off & U.K. armed forces joined in the destruction of a sovereign nation. Nobody thinks it’s a safer place for it’s people or it’s neighbouring countries either. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have predictably been killed, murdered by our lying leaders, lying right into our faces. The UN declared that war illegal. There isn’t any dispute about it.

So here we have at least two cases where we can be absolutely certain that officialdom lied to its own people about something so momentous that people were thereby killed. Deliberately. For whatever purposes.

So when people like me use all my substantial skill and career long judgement to tell anyone who’ll listen that the mRNA / DNA based injections were designed intentionally to cause injury and death, why would you not at least listen and demand the evidence, which I’ve often given?

Similarly, when those skilled in the science and practice of assessing climate & how it changes over time, and tell us that we’re being lied to about the importance of CO2 in this equation and that there’s no sign whatsoever of a crisis, now or imminently, why would one not at least consider the possibility that we’re being lied to, purposes unknown, by numerous authority figures?

You’d be very stubborn not to at least be alive to the possibility that you are being lied to by government and their agents. You’re off the foot of the “ladder of disbelief”. You know that politicians lie and that powerful people plot to their advantage.

All that’s being asked of you is that take a deliberately long, questioning look at both claimed pandemics as well as “safe and effective vaccines”, rustled up in an impossible timescale. All past vaccines took six or more years to bring to market and that was with skimpy clinical trials and readily mastered scaled up manufacturing. These unprecedented gene based injections are complex to manufacture and career experts in this niche of the pharmaceutical sector confirm it’s absolutely impossible that they did what they’ve said they did. 

Also do the same with “climate change”, examining particularly papers on polar ice cores, which have repeatedly shown us that temperature changes preceded changes in CO2, over & again, meaning CO2 cannot be the major driver that you’re told it is. Keep your privately owned ICE car. 

There’s more, but these are the brutal shoves being used to herd us into pens, such as “vaccine passports” from WHO and 15 minute cities from the UN, for purposes I don’t intend to elaborate on here.

Nobody is coming to save us. Nobody. But we can & must save ourselves by resisting and refusing these illegal shoves. 

Please, do not sign up for digital ID or vaccine passports. Don’t stop using cash.

I follow Harry Metcalfe because he’s got a garage full of wonderful cars. He’s obviously done well for himself, and he also farms (since 2002). 
A friend of Clarkson who lives nearby. 
Harry educates us on the climate impact myths of beef. It depends on geographic context and in places where growing grass is easy, there are no inputs other than little cows, to get big cows. 
The methane comes from carbohydrates trapped in grass by photosynthesis. It’s a cycle. It’s adds zero to fake climate change.
CO2 is anyway irrelevant.

If you’ve been a fan of Steve Kirsch, I recommend you read this very carefully.

You may recall that, when he interviewed me earlier this year, he showed no interest whatsoever in my assertion that, based on over 30 years experience of “rational drug design” rules, I was certain they had been designed intentionally to harm, kill & reduce fertility.
Instead of pushing back on this strong assertion, he tried to pick a fight with me about PCR tests, which I waved away as all but irrelevant given where we now were.

As the call closed, I put a line through yet another name.

Based on my own experience, you cannot be a freedom fighter AND retain an account with 100K+ followers on any social media platform and yet be genuine.
The perpetrators can silence you with a click, if they want to.

For this & several other reasons there’s no point in me attempting to set up an account on Twitter in my own name.

Do remember that nobody was ever coming to save us, but that we don’t need someone to save us. We need only want to save ourselves enough to make that a reality.

Many politicians have been inducted into the WEF...

Former UMNO (later Bersatu) minister Mustapa Mohamed and current trade minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz were most probably the two principal purveyors of the WEF to the Malaysian scene.

Today there are a number of ministers and politicians who are members of the WEF. Until very recently most openly acknowledged their association with the WEF, but a number have asked the organization to take their names off the WEF official website. However, in searching names there are records of meetings they attended and/or spoke at.

Current members of the WEF in the government include Azalina Otham Said, member since 2003, Nurul Izzah Anwar, a member since 2012, Steven Sim, a member since 2012, Hannah Yeoh, a member since 2018, and Yao Bee Yin, a member since 2019.

Nurul Izzah, one of the WEF’s rising stars.

Other notable politicians include Khairy Jamaluddin, a member since 2006, Hishammuddin Hussein, a member sine 1998, and Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, a member since 2019.

Malays have been indoctrinated that the Chinese covet control of Malaysia. The Malays are also taught to hate the Jews. However, these are just diversions to stop the Malays seeing what is really happening.

*Malays will continue to be serfs in their own land.* 

No one will see this story in the media, as much of the media is affiliated with the WEF. The government is now operating within the influence of the WEF. Malaysia is now almost unrecoverable from WEF influence.

Something isn’t right. Either I’m wrong about the board members of large multinationals or occasionally somebody defies the power.
I suppose a third option is that, in some way, this announcement serves the agenda of the totalitarians.
One to watch, anyway, because I’m well aware that Honda’s leadership is not the only one making less than positive comments about EVs recently.
That the wheels are falling off the control system would be lovely. If that’s what’s happening, we won’t need to guess at it, because we’d see a succession of events that one might anticipate in such a scenario.

The “Clean Atmosphere Preservation Act” (HB 1700) was introduced in New Hampshire: “an act prohibiting the intentional release of polluting emissions, including cloud seeding, weather modification, excessive electromagnetic radio frequency, and microwave radiation and making penalties for violation of such prohibition.” 

“The general court finds that many atmospheric activities such as weather modification, stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), solar radiation modification (SRM), and other forms of geoengineering, involving the intentional release of polluting emissions, harm human health and safety,  the environment, agriculture, wildlife, aviation, state security, and the economy of the state of New Hampshire.
It is therefore the intention of the general court to prohibit SAI geoengineering and other intentionally polluting activities in New Hampshire's atmosphere.”

‼️IMPORTANT:

Every time you hear the term 'fossil fuel' on the TV, radio, news, etc, you're being lied to. In 1892 at the Geneva Convention, the biggest man in the oil industry J.D. Rockefeller paid scientists to call oil a ""Fossil Fuel"", inducing the idea of scarcity in order to set a world price for oil. The truth is that oil is the 2nd most prevalent liquid on earth next to water, and at all times it is regenerating within the earth faster than it could ever be depleted 🧐🤨

“CO2, The Gas of Life,” features a lecture given at the Summit Old Guard Meeting in New Jersey, October 3, 2023, by William Happer, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of physics at Princeton University and former scientific adviser to the Bush and Trump administrations.

The topic: carbon dioxide (CO2), commonly mischaracterized as a harmful waste product of respiration and a pollutant that is disrupting the planetary climate. As explained by Happer in this lecture, CO2 is actually an essential gas necessary for life. Moreover, its impact on Earth’s temperatures is negligible, and will remain negligible even if the current concentration in the atmosphere were to double.

If you thought the greatest challenge to our liberty anywhere was from faked pandemics, economy- and society-wrecking “countermeasures” and intentionally injurious, sometimes lethal, false vaccines, I have worrisome news for you.

This utter nonsense about climate change has such heavyweight momentum behind it, with absolutely every stakeholder who has access to mass audiences already roped in, that I regard the billionaires desire to use it as a battering ram in the form of a “planetary health emergency” is every bit as bad if not worse.

In a fake pandemic, you could declare that you’re not prepared to play along and prefer isolation with other, unconcerned people. 

In an “anthropogenic climate emergency”, despite nothing happening at all, there’s no such scenario possible, because everything you do involves you adding to the “already unacceptable burdens upon our global commons”.

Get out of that one, if you can.

Dr Jacob Nordangard takes us through the 75+ years of the “elites” painstaking planning that has brought us here.

It is all fakery. We’re not “damaging the earth’s climate” one bit. The earth is not overpopulated. Despite fake modelling from the Club of Rome, there’s not a single unmanageable problem and in any case, population was already set to fall hard later this century in any case, now being given a firm push by “covid”. Some say we’re running out of “fossil fuels”, but oddly enough, it gets not a single mention except to point out its dominant claimed contribution to “climate emergency”.

In my opinion, there is no doubt that depopulation is the overarching objective of all of this, together with permanent, real-time, totalitarian control of earths peons, which is you, me and everyone not in The Big Club.

As I’m often drawn to retort, “There is a conspiracy. There’s nothing theoretical about it”.

Meanwhile, deaths from climate disasters are down, the economic cost of climate disasters is trending downwards, low lying Pacific islands are increasing in size, and the number of polar bears is increasing. 

It’s time we stopped messing around. 

Clearly, fossil fuels are feeding the world, greening the land, and boosting tree growth. Anyone who gives a damn about the environment needs to start campaigning to increase our fossil fuel emissions.

….. a new study shows that the Earth is not only still getting greener, but that the rate of green growth is accelerating on more than half of the world.

If we care about the children, we have a duty to liberate that coal, burn that oil …… 



…

I think this is correct.
There’s a fellow called Alex Epstein who is promoting a “fossil” fuel future.
I’m suspicious of many things these days and Alex Epstein is no exception. Is he a limited hangout?
Regardless, he’s right, here. It wouldn’t matter if we further doubled atmospheric [CO2].

The Rockefellers, along with other wealthy donors including the philanthropy of Michael Bloomberg, have provided millions of dollars in recent years to front-line environmental groups that are campaigning against fossil-fuel projects, including LNG terminals that have been proposed on the Gulf Coast, according to people familiar with the effort. 

Some green funders hadn’t given much attention to the LNG exports until recently, in part because of ambivalence about the role natural gas should play in the energy transition. Plus, some previous campaigns to kill LNG terminals had been unsuccessful, damping some donors’ and large environmental organizations’ appetite for taking on the industry. 

The billionaire-backed campaign, starting around four years ago, worked to identify and fund community leaders already campaigning against fossil-fuel projects. The activists buttonholed White House and federal officials in Washington, Houston and Dubai as part of a high-intensity grassroots campaign. ""

Farmers are the backbone for the wellbeing, health and existence of nations throughout the world.
The WEF and lying politicians like the Evil Ursula Von der lein are blaming the small farmers and the fertilizers they use as the major cause of climate, not the jets that the WEF rides in. What climate change are they talking about? Chemical industries are the biggest polluters of the quality of air.

The WEF wants to bankrupt the the farmers so that people like gates and Monsanto will pick up these farms dirt cheap and grow non nutritious gmo food , lab meat and insects as the main supply.

These big corporations and wealthy individuals will control
the entire food supply and they will control the price of food.

We all know what happened during Covid. Only the supermarkets and big chain stores were open. All the small stores were closed.

We saw oil go up to R100 for two litres of cooking oil.

Once the small farmer is destroyed, the majority of the world's population will die of starvation because they won't be able to afford the artificially manufactured food, the few  who can afford it will end up becoming ill through nutritional deficiencies. This will suit the pharmaceutical and supplement industry.

The farmers' protest is a protest for our survival and our rights, they need our full support.
Our government leaders are mere tools of the WEF.

If you think you are going to elect an official that represents you then you living cloud cookooland .
These clowns are in politics to see what they can get out of it for themselves. The most educated and most religious have been corrupted by the WEF. You don't hear about it because the media and news that you follow is all owned by the WEF.

This is how I see it.  There is a facade that if they remove ICE vehicles and convert residential energy to renewables that we will stop pumping fossil fuels.  This is a farce.  They will continue to pump just as much fossil fuels to continue running their industrial processes and pump out their product as listed in the diagram.  That won't change, ""they"" (i.e. the corporations do exert significant control on what happens in an economy and their greed knows no bound. 

So in a nutshell, what will happen in the future is they will say the general population can only use renewable and since industry is so critical to the well being of society that hydrocarbons are reserved for industry.

Now let's transition to economics.  If a huge segment of hydrocarbons demand is reduced then supply increases and prices goes down.  Industry gets a price discount while keeping pricing the same.  Expanded production ensues.  All this resulting in increased profits.  This may not be fully coordinated but it is the end result.  Assuming ""they"" get their way.

That diagram makes the incorrect assumption that ""they"" will end hydrocarbons.  That is fantasy, it will continue to pump, to the benefit of themselves and will translate into nothing to us, we will still have everything we have now.

What I am fighting for is having a rational energy policy that does not leave the general population at a disadvantage, and that includes hydrocarbons, nuclear and renewable if they make sense.
